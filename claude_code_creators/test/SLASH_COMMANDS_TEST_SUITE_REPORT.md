## TDD Implementation Guidance

### Expected Failures
All tests are designed to fail initially due to missing:
1. **CommandParserService** class and methods
2. **CommandExecutionService** class and command handlers
3. **CommandsController** and API routes
4. **SlashCommandsController** Stimulus controller
5. **CommandSuggestionsComponent** ViewComponent
6. **Command history and audit models**
7. **Database migrations for command tables**

### Implementation Order
Tests guide this implementation sequence:
1. **Models & Migrations** (CommandHistory, CommandAuditLog)
2. **Service Layer** (CommandParserService, CommandExecutionService)
3. **Controller Layer** (CommandsController, API routes)
4. **Frontend Layer** (Stimulus controller, ViewComponent)
5. **Integration** (ActionCable, real-time updates)

### Quality Gates
Tests enforce these requirements:
- Command parsing in <100ms for performance
- All 6 commands must be registered and functional
- Comprehensive error handling with helpful messages
- Full accessibility compliance (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Security validation (authentication, authorization)
- Data consistency across operations

## Next Steps for Implementation

### For ruby-rails-expert:
1. Create database migrations for CommandHistory and CommandAuditLog
2. Implement CommandParserService with registry and validation
3. Implement CommandExecutionService with all 6 command handlers
4. Create CommandsController with API endpoints
5. Add command routes to routes.rb
6. Integrate with existing models (Document, ContextItem, ClaudeContext)

### For javascript-package-expert:
1. Create SlashCommandsController Stimulus controller
2. Implement command detection and suggestion logic
3. Add keyboard navigation and accessibility features
4. Create CommandSuggestionsComponent ViewComponent
5. Style command suggestion UI with Tailwind CSS
6. Integrate with existing editor components

### For test-runner-fixer:
After implementation, verify:
1. All 169+ tests pass successfully
2. Test coverage maintains 85%+ requirement
3. Performance benchmarks are met
4. Integration tests verify full workflows
5. System tests confirm browser compatibility

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all 6 slash commands
- ✅ Tests cover all architectural layers (service, controller, frontend)
- ✅ Error scenarios and edge cases included
- ✅ Performance and accessibility requirements defined
- ✅ TDD approach with proper failing tests
- ✅ Integration with existing codebase structure

The test suite is complete and ready to guide the implementation of the Phase 1.1 slash commands system. All tests are failing as expected and will turn green as the ruby-rails-expert and javascript-package-expert implement the corresponding functionality.
