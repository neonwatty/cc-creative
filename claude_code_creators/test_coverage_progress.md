## Priority Order
1. **🔴 Critical (Do First)**
   - Fix SimpleCov configuration
   - SessionsController (auth is critical)
   - ClaudeService (core functionality)
   - User model (foundation)

2. **🟡 High Priority**
   - ViewComponents with existing tests
   - Document-related models/controllers
   - Cloud integration services

3. **🟢 Standard Priority**
   - Missing test files
   - Helper coverage
   - System tests

## Blocking Issues
- [ ] SimpleCov may not be configured correctly - showing 0% for files with tests
- [ ] Need to verify test_helper.rb SimpleCov setup
- [ ] May need to add `require 'simplecov'` to individual test files

## Quick Wins Completed
- [ ] Set up coverage rake task
- [ ] Fix SimpleCov configuration
- [ ] Add CI coverage reporting
- [ ] Create test factories
- [ ] Add coverage badge to README

## Notes
- Many files show 0% coverage despite having tests - investigate SimpleCov config
- ViewComponent tests may need `render_inline` to register coverage
- Controller tests may need to actually call actions, not just test setup
