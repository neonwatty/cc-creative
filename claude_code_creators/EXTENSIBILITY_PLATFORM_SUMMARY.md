- **/suggest** - AI suggestions for improvements and optimizations  
  - Types: refactor, optimize, enhance, fix, extend
  - Returns prioritized suggestions with examples and benefits
  
- **/critique** - Critical analysis of code architecture and design
  - Aspects: architecture, patterns, maintainability, scalability, testability
  - Provides strengths, weaknesses, and design recommendations
