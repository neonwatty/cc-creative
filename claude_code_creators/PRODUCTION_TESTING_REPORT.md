## üîß Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Production)
1. **Security Hardening:**
   ```ruby
   # Add to Gemfile
   gem 'rack-attack'
   
   # Configure password validation
   validates :password, length: { minimum: 12 }, format: { with: /\A(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]/ }
   
   # Fix logging filters
   config.filter_parameters += [:password, :password_confirmation, :current_password]
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting Setup:**
   ```ruby
   # config/application.rb
   config.middleware.use Rack::Attack
   
   # config/initializers/rack_attack.rb
   Rack::Attack.throttle('login', limit: 5, period: 60.seconds) do |req|
     req.ip if req.path == '/session' && req.post?
   end
   ```

3. **Session Security:**
   ```ruby
   # config/application.rb
   config.session_store :cookie_store, 
     expire_after: 2.hours,
     same_site: :lax,
     secure: Rails.env.production?
   ```

### Performance Optimizations (Post-Production)
1. Implement Redis for session storage
