## Strategic Analysis

### Coverage Gap Analysis (Corrected from Initial Report)
The initial report showing 0% model coverage was incorrect due to the SimpleCov configuration issue. Current actual status:

| Category | Current Coverage | Priority | Impact |
|----------|------------------|----------|---------|
| Models | 50%+ | Medium | 2 models at 100%, others need expansion |
| Controllers | 25%+ | High | OAuth and complex workflows need tests |
| Services | 15%+ | High | Cloud services need VCR/WebMock setup |
| Components | 0% | Medium | ViewComponent configuration needed |
| Jobs | 0% | Medium | Background job test helpers needed |
| Channels | 18%+ | Low | ActionCable tests partially complete |
