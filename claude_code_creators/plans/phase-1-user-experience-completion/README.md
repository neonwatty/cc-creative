**Tasks**: 
- Verify existing test suite functionality (169+ tests)
- Fix any failing tests in current implementation
- Ensure CommandParserService passes all parsing tests
- Complete CommandExecutionService with all 6 command handlers:
  - `/save` - Save document/context to various formats
  - `/load` - Load saved context into session
  - `/compact` - AI-powered context summarization  
  - `/clear` - Clear context or document content
  - `/include` - Include file content in context
  - `/snippet` - Save selected content as reusable snippet
- Create CommandsController API endpoints
- Add proper error handling and validation
**Quality Gates**: All service and controller tests pass

#### Sub-phase 1.1.2: Frontend Implementation
**Agent**: javascript-package-expert → tailwind-css-expert
**Tasks**:
- Enhance SlashCommandsController Stimulus controller
- Complete command detection and suggestion logic
- Add keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)

- Implement debouncing and performance optimizations
**Quality Gates**: All frontend tests pass, accessibility compliant

#### Sub-phase 1.1.3: Code Quality & Integration
**Agent**: ruby-rails-expert → javascript-package-expert → test-runner-fixer
**Tasks**:
- Run RuboCop linting on all Ruby files
- Run ESLint on all JavaScript files
- Fix all linting errors
- Run full integration test suite
- Verify system tests pass in browser
- Performance testing (command parsing <100ms)
**Quality Gates**: Zero linting errors, all 169+ tests pass

### Phase 1.2: Enhanced File Editing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Objective**: Advanced editing features for improved user experience

#### Sub-phase 1.2.1: Editor Enhancements
**Agent**: javascript-package-expert
**Tasks**:
- Advanced syntax highlighting improvements

  - Suggestion display: <50ms
  - Command execution: <2s
  - Real-time updates: <200ms latency

## Architecture Integration Points

### Existing Systems Integration
- **Editor System**: Integrate with existing EditorController
- **Context Management**: Leverage existing ContextItem model
- **User System**: Use existing User and authentication
- **Document System**: Extend Document model for command operations
- **Cloud Integration**: Connect with existing CloudFile system

### Database Schema Extensions
Required tables (may already exist):
- `command_histories` - Command execution tracking
- `command_audit_logs` - Security and compliance logging
- Enhanced `claude_contexts` - Command execution context

### API Extensions
New endpoints to implement:
- `POST /documents/:id/commands` - Execute slash commands
- `GET /documents/:id/commands/suggestions` - Get command suggestions
- `GET /documents/:id/commands/history` - Command execution history

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Performance with Large Documents**
   - Mitigation: Implement debouncing, optimize parsing
2. **Concurrent Command Execution**  
   - Mitigation: Proper locking, conflict detection
3. **Frontend/Backend Synchronization**
   - Mitigation: Robust error handling, retry mechanisms

### Medium Risks
1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement, polyfills
2. **Mobile Interface Challenges**
   - Mitigation: Responsive design, touch optimization
