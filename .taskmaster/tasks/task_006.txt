# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement File Integration with Cloud Services
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect Google Drive, Dropbox, Notion, or manually upload files to import/export whole documents or folders into the workspace.
# Details:
1. Set up ActiveStorage for file handling:
   ```ruby
   # Run ActiveStorage installation
   rails active_storage:install
   ```
2. Add necessary gems for cloud service integrations:
   ```ruby
   # Gemfile
   gem 'google_drive'
   gem 'dropbox_api'
   gem 'notion-ruby-client'
   ```
3. Create service objects for each cloud provider:
   ```ruby
   # app/services/google_drive_service.rb
   class GoogleDriveService
     def initialize(user)
       @user = user
       # Setup authentication using user's credentials
     end

     def list_files
       # Implementation
     end

     def import_file(file_id)
       # Implementation
     end

     def export_document(document, folder_id = nil)
       # Implementation
     end
   end
   ```
4. Create similar services for Dropbox and Notion
5. Implement OAuth flow for each service
6. Create UI for connecting accounts
7. Implement file browser for each service
8. Add import/export functionality
9. Create background jobs for file operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test OAuth authentication flow for each service
2. Verify file listing functionality
3. Test file import from each service
4. Verify document export to each service
5. Test error handling for API failures
6. Ensure file operations work asynchronously
