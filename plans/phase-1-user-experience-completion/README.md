- **Export System**: 90% line coverage, 85% branch coverage  
- **Sharing System**: 95% line coverage, 90% branch coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Cover all major user workflows

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Command Performance Impact**
   - Risk: Slash commands slow down editor responsiveness
   - Mitigation: Implement debouncing and async processing

2. **Export Generation Timeouts**
   - Risk: Large documents cause export timeouts
   - Mitigation: Background job processing with progress tracking

3. **Sharing Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Risk: Unauthorized access to shared documents
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive authorization testing and security review

### Business Risks
1. **User Adoption of Commands**
   - Risk: Users don't discover or use slash commands
   - Mitigation: Clear onboarding and command suggestion UI

2. **Export Quality Issues**
   - Risk: Exported documents lose formatting or content
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing with real-world documents

## Architecture Considerations

### Command System Architecture
```
Editor Input → Command Detection → Command Parser → Service Execution → Response Handler → UI Update
```

### Export System Architecture
```
Export Request → Format Validation → Background Job → Service Processing → File Generation → Download/Share
```

### Sharing System Architecture
```
Share Request → Permission Setup → Link Generation → Access Control → Public Viewer → Analytics
```
