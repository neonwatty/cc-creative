| **Performance Degradation** | All | Continuous performance monitoring | Defer non-critical features |
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | Phase 1, 4 | Security scanning, penetration testing | Immediate security patches |
| **Feature Scope Creep** | All | Clear phase boundaries, change control | Feature postponement to future releases |

### Risk Escalation Protocol

1. **Agent Level**: Agent attempts resolution within expertise
2. **Orchestrator Level**: Cross-agent coordination and resource reallocation
3. **Plan Revision**: Scope adjustment or timeline modification
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Major scope or timeline changes
